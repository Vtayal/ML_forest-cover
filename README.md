# ML_forest-cover
The aim of this project is to predict the type of forest cover using Machine Learning.
In the given training data we have features like elevation of the area, slope, hillshade at different times of the day, wilderness area, soil type, etc. and the label was "Forest Cover Type", trained the model using these features and different Machine Learning Algorithms. To remove unnecessary features Data Visualization was done. Then predict the type of Forest Cover, using the best algorithm, from the testing data set.
